## stocksmith expenses list

List expenses

### Synopsis

List expenses (purchases) from your Stocksmith account.

An expense is a supplier purchase — header totals plus the materials and costs
on each line. RECEIPT is the three-state rollup over the lines: received,
partial, or outstanding. Filter by purchase-date range, change time, category,
supplier, or receipt state. Use --all to fetch all pages, or --ndjson for
streaming NDJSON output suitable for data pipelines.
